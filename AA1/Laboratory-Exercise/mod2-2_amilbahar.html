		    <p> Hanako is an urban legend said to be the spirit of a young girl that haunts school toilets, but as nene finds out, her academy's Hanako is actually a boy, and he is only one of many spirits inhabiting the place. At Kamome Academy, rumors abound about the school's Seven Mysteries, one of which is Hanako-san .</p>
